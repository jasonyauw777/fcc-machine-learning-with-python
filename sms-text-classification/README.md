# Summary (Natural Language Processing)

Using the the SMS Spam Collection dataset (Labeled Dataset) where the data is already split into train and test data, I created and successfully trained a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model using the Tensorflow framework that is able to classify SMS messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" with 99% training accuracy and 98% testing accuracy on the train and test datasets.
