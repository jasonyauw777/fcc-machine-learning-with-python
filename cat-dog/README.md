# Summary (Image Classification)

Using the cats and dogs dataset where the data is split into train, validation and test datasets. I created and trained a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model using the Tensorflow framework that is able to succefully classify images of cats and dogs with 73% training and 71% testing accuracy.
