# Summary (KNN)

Using the Book-Crossings dataset, I created a book recommendation algotithm using K-Nearest Neighbours with the sklearn library that will show a list of 5 similar books from the current book chosen. The KNN algorithm measures distance to determine the "closeness" of instances. The 5 books shown will be the ones with the shortest distance with the current book.
