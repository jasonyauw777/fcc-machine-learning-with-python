# Summary (Linear Regression)

Using a labelled dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs (expenses column), I created and trained a Linear Regresion model using the Tensorflow framework and the existing data to predict healthcare costs using new data. The Linear Regression model has a mean absolute error of 1570 which means that the model is able to predict healthcare costs correctly within $ 1570.
